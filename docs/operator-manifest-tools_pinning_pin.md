## operator-manifest-tools pinning pin

Pins to digest all the image references from the CSVs found in MANIFEST_DIR.

### Synopsis

Pins to digest all the image references from the CSVs found in MANIFEST_DIR. For
each image reference, if a tag is used, it is resolved to a digest by querying the
container image registry. Then, replaces all the image references in the CSVs with
the resolved, pinned, version.
